## 2.2.0/1.2.0 Technical Update II: OS Specific Code and Permanent Data

1. class DataPoint was replaced with record DataPointRecord.
    1. Records in Java are special classes that are similar to Strings, they're immutable.

> The data stored will never change, so I can use a record
> instead of a class. This will ensure that the data will
> not be able to be changed by accident.

Most Changes below are in Settings.java

2. Constants.java > Settings.java since it reads settings.txt.
3. Created enum Platform in Launcher.
   > Dictates the platform of the App. Used to differentiate between platforms
4. Code base split by the Platform enums for platform specific code.
5. multiple filepaths had the same lines. now they have a basepath and an addonpath

- basepath: the path to the main folder of the application
- addonpath: these are paths that are files inside application folder.
    1. Basepath: C:/Users/{User}/MyProject<br>
    2. Addonpath: /screenchart/scatterchart<br>
    3. Fullpath: C:/Users/{User}/MyProject/screenchart/scatterchart

6. ScatterChart and TableView screenshots are having their platform specific folder.
7. Filepaths now are moved from Settings to FilePath with FilePathFactory.
8. (not implemented) custom logger created.
9. (not implemented) logger will generate log files in /log
10. Created interface Exitter. interface used to exit the program by entering a error message
11. (not implemented) class DataLogger and DataLoggerFactory
12. (not implemented) used to write data to a csv in the time,depth format
13. There are more Exceptions to pinpoint problem
14. exceptions when thrown will print error in console and show a dialog box.
15. Exceptions close and stop the app.
16. settings will get new format for packetData

> packetData=<company_id>-<company_name>,pkt-,time,unit2

- User will be able to replace depth with temp, etc.
- creates a new settings variable:
    - unit2_name
  > unit2_name=Temperature
    - unit2_unit
  > unit2_unit=°C
- the packetData with unit2 will look like below
  > packetData=PN12-MiramarWaterJets,pkt-,time,**_unit2_**<br>
  unit2_name=Temperature<br>
  unit2_unit=°C
- With this, the secondary unit can be anything

17. Internal version will be converted to a 4 place version
    > 2.2.0 > 2.1.2.0<br>
    Build_Version **_._** Major_Version **_._** Minor_Version **_._** Patch_Version

- The new internal version is changed to represent the release version
  and to avoid confusion: 2.2.0 != 1.2.0

18. To make the unit of time flexible "time_unit" is introduced. it can be any unit like hours, mins, etc. The user has
    to convert the data beforehand.
